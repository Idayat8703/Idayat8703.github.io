It’s been a month since I joined the world of coding. I’m not going to lie it’s been a bit tough at times. I also wanted to pull out my hair when I couldn’t figure out the code. But I’m still loving the learning experience. I know I’m on a learning curve and it will only be a matter of time before I able to code in my sleep. 

Currently, I’m learning HTML and CSS. I think it’s cool learning how to create a website/ webpage and learning how to be creative with the CSS. I love doing the code along as It’s a great teaching tool for me to go set by step with the videos to help guide me through the process of creating different attributes on a webpage.  CSS is not easy on the first glance but once I understand the tricks of CSS, I think I will be able to get a better handle on the topic. I’m still having a great time learning this topic but I know I will get a lab that will blow my mind at the end of this topic. 

But, overall is been a good month and I’m excited to continue learning the awesomeness of coding. 

Bring it on!
