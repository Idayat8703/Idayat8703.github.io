Hi there! I just completed my Sinatra Portfolio Project, which is a workout-tracker CRUD app. The app is meant to store a user’s workouts! A user is able to create an account, login, logout, view their workout, add workouts to their plan, edit items, and delete items.

Here’s a link to a walkthrough of my application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9rJNlf4_Dg&feature=youtu.be
