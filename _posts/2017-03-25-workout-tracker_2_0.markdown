I finished my Rails final project and I am extremely happy with the results! The best part of programming this project was that I actually felt confident in what I was doing. Yes, I had to reference how to do some stuff and yes, google was my friend, but that is not a bad thing. It feels amazing that I was able to know exactly what I wanted to make, how I wanted to make it, and that I knew enough to ask the right questions and get it done.

I obviously used Rails to complete this project. Honestly, one of the trickiest parts was figuring out how to properly set up a new Rails app and include the right gems because in most labs this is already done for us. Luckily, Rails has a really handy guide to pretty much everything you could ever need to know!
 

I used Devise to create a user model with the ability to sign up, sign in, sign out, and more. Honestly, Devise is so awesome and saved me a whole lot of trouble! I also used Omniauth to allow users to sign in with Facebook. I find it extremely interesting to see how that works, but it is very complicated and is probably something I will have to reference for a while.


I added a little bit of CSS and wrapped it up. I think it turned out pretty okay.
