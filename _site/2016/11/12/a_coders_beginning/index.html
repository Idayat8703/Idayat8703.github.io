    <p>Hi my name is Idayat.  I’m an accounting professional who’s always had an interest in coding from childhood. From the age of 7, I always had an interest in playing video games and having fun with my computer at an early age.  I’ve always played with computer as a child and never left my computer screen until it was time for bed. As I got older, I started to get very interesting in video games from Nintendo to PS4. And, still was curious on how people developed these cool games.</p>

<p>As I attended college, I didn’t know how to pursue my interest in coding because I didn’t have much guidance.  So, I ended up going to school to do accounting. Accounting is so boring and not that interesting. As time went on, I went to a couple of meetups over the weekend to learn how to code and It was so interesting. At the time, I was learning from codeacadamy and other pretty cool websites. I also read a couple of cool books too.  But I never had the full-blown courage to say let me pursue coding professionally. Until I spoke to my significant other and told me to take coding more seriously.</p>

<p>I was very nervous at first but I said to myself everyone has their own learning curve and I will soon be able grasp everything I need to know about coding.  I’ve learned so much about coding in the last couple of days and It’s not as easy as it looks but I’m so intrigued and happy that I’m taking the steps to purse this professionally.  I’m having so much fun and I look forward to tackling my tic-tac board now because it’s a challenge that I must take on. But even as things get a little more challenging I’m having a very good time learning the different ways I can talk to my program to get an amazing output I want.  I feel like coding is my second language that I like learning.</p>

<p>Let my journey being!!!</p>
