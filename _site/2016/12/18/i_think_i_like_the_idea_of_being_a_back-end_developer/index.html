  <title>I think I like the idea of being a back-end developer!</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Over the last couple of weeks I’ve learned a ton of HTML, CSS and other cool things in regards to Ruby. 
When I started learning about HTML and CSS I thought it was pretty dope. I’m the type of person that needs to be able to see what it is that I’m doing and how what I’m writing changes the look of certain thing. I was able to understand the use of various classes, id, parents and children while working with CSS. It’s nice to see the changes I’m making in real time and doing the various changes to a particular site. 
But, as I’ve continued to learn more about web devlopment. I really find myself liking the idea of being a back-end developer and making the framework of an app and building something awesome with the use of various array, hashes, using various methods to retain my information.  My journey is not yet over but back-end is pretty much my favorite at this point in time.
