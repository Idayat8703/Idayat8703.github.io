  <title>CLI gem Project</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Oh man Oh man. I’m not going to lie this was a bit of a challenge for me. I didn’t know what to do or how to start this project. But nothing was going to stop me. I had endless night of using google as my best friend. After watching Avi walk through I was able to start CLI gem which gave me steps in the right direction. I did tons of brainstorming I came up with an idea that would let me gather the most recent news article from the NYT from various categories. I think the scraping was the best part for me in general. I was kinda nervous at first but I was able to gather all the information I need to be able to have my CLI  gem working.

    <p>Oh man Oh man. I’m not going to lie this was a bit of a challenge for me. I didn’t know what to do or how to start this project. But nothing was going to stop me. I had endless night of using google as my best friend. After watching Avi walk through I was able to start CLI gem which gave me steps in the right direction. I did tons of brainstorming I came up with an idea that would let me gather the most recent news article from the NYT from various categories. I think the scraping was the best part for me in general. I was kinda nervous at first but I was able to gather all the information I need to be able to have my CLI  gem working.</p>

<p>Very slowly I started to figure out how II wanted to tackle this project. Originally I wanted to put the description of each article as well. But I could think of how that would be possible. I ponder for 2 days and I thought I was stuck. I would talk my ideas through with my best friend and she told me that it would be easier to leave out the description and have the user click the link to read the full article. I gave my best friend the biggest hug because I had a serious coder’s block.</p>

<p>Then all my ideas started to come together and It made me feel good seeing the hard work and my late night being display on my computer. Gave me a lil more confidence in my future in programming.</p>

<p>Please check out me repo and give me ton of feedback..
