        <p class="excerpt">Having finished my final JavaScript project, I definitely feel like I have come a long way. It is really cool seeing all of the stuff that I have learned come together. When I first started working on this project, I had a lot of trouble because I didn’t feel too confident with JavaScript. I felt like I had kind of breezed through the JavaScript lessons without really taking the time to understand what I was learning and how to actually apply it. Due to that, when I started this project, I had no idea where to begin. Finally, I decided that the best thing would be to redo the JavaScript lessons that I was shaky on and I am so glad that I did. After redoing some of the lessons, I feel so much more confident using JavaScript and I definitely have a better appreciation for it as a whole! So here is how I applied it to my fitness tracking application that I created for my final Rails project.

        <p class="excerpt">I finished my Rails final project and I am extremely happy with the results! The best part of programming this project was that I actually felt confident in what I was doing. Yes, I had to reference how to do some stuff and yes, google was my friend, but that is not a bad thing. It feels amazing that I was able to know exactly what I wanted to make, how I wanted to make it, and that I knew enough to ask the right questions and get it done.

        <p class="excerpt">Hi there! I just completed my Sinatra Portfolio Project, which is a workout-tracker CRUD app. The app is meant to store a user’s workouts! A user is able to create an account, login, logout, view their workout, add workouts to their plan, edit items, and delete items.

        <p class="excerpt">Oh man Oh man. I’m not going to lie this was a bit of a challenge for me. I didn’t know what to do or how to start this project. But nothing was going to stop me. I had endless night of using google as my best friend. After watching Avi walk through I was able to start CLI gem which gave me steps in the right direction. I did tons of brainstorming I came up with an idea that would let me gather the most recent news article from the NYT from various categories. I think the scraping was the best part for me in general. I was kinda nervous at first but I was able to gather all the information I need to be able to have my CLI  gem working.

        <p class="excerpt">Over the last couple of weeks I’ve learned a ton of HTML, CSS and other cool things in regards to Ruby. 
When I started learning about HTML and CSS I thought it was pretty dope. I’m the type of person that needs to be able to see what it is that I’m doing and how what I’m writing changes the look of certain thing. I was able to understand the use of various classes, id, parents and children while working with CSS. It’s nice to see the changes I’m making in real time and doing the various changes to a particular site. 
But, as I’ve continued to learn more about web devlopment. I really find myself liking the idea of being a back-end developer and making the framework of an app and building something awesome with the use of various array, hashes, using various methods to retain my information.  My journey is not yet over but back-end is pretty much my favorite at this point in time.
